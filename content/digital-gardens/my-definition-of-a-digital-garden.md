# What Is a Digital Garden?

A close friend of mine introduced me to digital gardens through [Joel Hook's post about it](), and I continued searching about the topic and reading many people's descriptions of them. It struck me as exactly the kind of thing I'm interested in, because I'd been wanting to create a site to openly post about things I've learned, things I'm interested in, and a variety of things I want to share, but I didn't want to go through the trouble of building a site from scratch. You see, I'm perfectly capable of doing that, but my day job is web Software as a Service software development. The last thing I want to do after a long, challenging day of coding is more coding for a simple vanity site! So, I think of a digital garden as my place to share my notes, topics of interest, things I've learned, and in many ways a simple vanity site.

# Why not a blog?

Well, I did start a blog, but then I read an interesting post in how blogs broke the spirit of the internet. The main idea of the author was that the internet started as a way to share information, information that could be updated for accuracy or new discovery over time. When blogs began to develop, the focus was more about the date the information was posted. The focus on date over the information in the post can begin to decrease the value of the information over time. Attracting views became more about frequency and quantity rather than quality of the information in the content being produced. I'd like to think a digital garden approach is more like Wikipedia, in that the information is curated for accuracy and relevancy over time.
