# My Digital Garden Conventions

I'll be using the following conventions as I cultivate my digital garden.

## Seedlings, Growing, and Evergreen
As I researched digital gardens, I ran across the concept of categorizing the general completeness stage of the content being created/consumed. I'll indicate what stage I believe my content to be in through the use of the "seedling", "growing", and "evergreen" tags. Here's how I define these completeness stages:
* **seedling:** First draft, place holder, new idea, or content that I otherwise feel is in it's very beginning stages.
* **growing:** Pretty well established, but I don't feel like it deserves my "stamp of completeness" yet.
* **evergreen:** I really don't plan to edit this content again. I feel like this content represents what I wanted to get across and can't envision changing it.
