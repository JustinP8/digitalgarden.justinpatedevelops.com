# My Digital Garden Conventions

I'll be using the following conventions as I cultivate my digital garden.

## Seedlings, Growing, and Evergreen
As I researched digital gardens, I ran across the concept of categorizing the general completeness stage of the content being created/consumed. I'll indicate what stage I believe my content to be in through the use of the "seedling", "growing", and "evergreen" tags. Here's how I define these completeness stages:
* **seedling:** First draft, place holder, new idea, or content that I otherwise feel is in it's very beginning stages.
* **growing:** Pretty well established, but I don't feel like it deserves my "stamp of completeness" yet.
* **evergreen:** I really don't plan to edit this content again. I feel like this content represents what I wanted to get across and can't envision changing it.

## Categories, Tags, Series
This PaperMod theme for HUGO came with the wiring for series, categories, and tags. Here's how I'm planning to use those:
* **series:** If I ever have a series of content that relates together but I've split up for practicality, comprehension, or maintainability.
* **categories:** For now, I'm thinking of these like folders, and using them for content pages that all fall under the same umbrella. 
* **tags:** Very often, my content will fall under multiple areas, categories, of my life. Here, in addition to the tags for seedling, growing, and evergreen content, I'll put tags for anything I feel noteworthy in the content. For instance, I may wind up listing the use of a software in my "hobbies" category, but I may also list that software in articles in my "career" category as well; in this case, I would tag both articles with that software's name.
