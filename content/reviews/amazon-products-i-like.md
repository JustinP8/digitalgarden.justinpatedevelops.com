Here I plan to post some Amazon products that I bought that I _really_ thing were a good purchase. I've tried to categorize it as best I can think of, and the handy table of contents above can help you peruse my selections. It will take me a while to build up the content here, because I've bought a lot of things.  Also, I'm not using affiliate links, I probably should...but I'm not trying to make any money here...

##### Books

* _[The Sketchnote Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321857895/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_DF654EF7WRMY51PY137X?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)_ by Mike Rohde - I've only created a couple of sketchnotes for some presentations I watched at work, but I plan on doing this to take notes on books, and this book is a great guide with some great techniques for everyone, yes...even "non-artists", can use to make great notes!

##### Useful Things

* [Klarus HC3 Hat Clip On Light](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W6MWTMH?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_1H4TDJDBJPHZD17SFY0Y) - this light is the best light I've received as a gift for those late night walks with the dog!


##### Hobby Items

* [BoardGameTables.com Play Mat](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09W1J7ZQH?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_H2DZMEMBSK6PD4XK1Q1P) - This creates a nice surface for playing board games on. I especially find that it's easier to pick up cards off of this foamy surface than a hard dining room table. I also enjoy that it's a good background for tile placement games like Carcassone. Also, this reduces dice noise very, very nicely.

* [TOZO NC9 Wireless, Noise Cancelling Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FT94NQ5?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_VCW7FRHFX1CG6105CZH6) - This is my second model of wireless earbuds from TOZO. I lost my first by leaving them at a hotel on vacation, but these are definitely an improvement with the noise cancelling feature. Sure, they're not perfect and the touch controls are a bit..."touchy", but they're pretty good for the price!

##### Health and Wellness

* [FLYBIRD Adjustable Weight Bench](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HNLBZ4Y?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_Y4Z0766T1AF1TDRHHCH1) - I use this weight bench in conjunction with the dumbbells set below every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday with a trainer that visits my house. Works great and wasn't that pricy!

* [Eazylyfe Dumbbells Set](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NSWHM2G?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_3C7TYZGSP5H44RVX2XH9) - This weight set comes with a lot of features. I mostly use the dumbbells, but I've used the kettle bell and barbell attachments a bit too. The weights aren't the greatest quality, but they've held up for a couple of years so far!

##### Productivity Supplies

* [RETTACY Dotted Grid Bullet Journals](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083J6PYLR?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_B840TC9EA9G3NWSSTZM0) - This is the second brand of journals I've bought from Amazon. The last ones were a bit better simply by being bigger and coming with some free page markers, but these are just as good in regard to page thickness and pair up nicely with the Uniball fine, needle tipped, gel pens I like the best. I use these every day for a bullet journal, and when I write a page during my [Miracle Morning practice](https://www.justinpatedevelops.com/review-the-miracle-morning-2/).
