I'm not sure how I picked up boardgames as a hobby, but it's likely from seeing folks play some and hearing about them from a brother-in-law of mine. Anyway, I enjoy strategy boardgames the most, but I play a variety with my family. None of the following are very time consuming or too in depth, though hopefully that will change as my children grow up some more and can handle more complex game play and rules!

* [Settlers of Catan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13/catan) - Pretty much the de-facto entry into European style strategy boardgames, and likely the hobby as a whole.
  * Genres: Strategy
  * Here's a nice online version of this game: [Colonist](https://www.colonist.io)
  * There's tons of expansions, start with the base game and read up on which ones sound fun if you want to after that.

* [Splendor](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148228/splendor) - My first "engine building" game. Buy cards with tokens, cards count as permanent tokens to help with bigger purchase, cards are worth a point value, first to 15 points wins.
  * Genres: Strategy, Engine Building
  * I actually own the [Splendor: Marvel](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/293296/splendor-marvel), which is kind of like the best of the original and the expansions combined and has one extra victory requirement that makes the game just a little more challenging in a good way.
  * Here's a nice online version of the game: [Spendee](https://spendee.mattle.online/welcome). The matchmaking lobby isn't all that great, but I prefer to simply play against 1 CPU for quick little matches. They have a mobile app as well, but it's not as good imho because of the smaller real estate.

* [King of Tokyo](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/70323/king-tokyo) - Super fun combination of Yahtzee and King of the Hill combined with a Kaiju theme.
  * Genres: Family, Dice, Strategy


I'll be adding more, I assure you. This is just my first quick draft.
