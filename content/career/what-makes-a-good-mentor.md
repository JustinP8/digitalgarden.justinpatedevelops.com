The further I get into my career, the more I hear from people that I have been a good mentor for them. I don't actively _try_ to mentor someone, but I do try to pass on things I have learned from people I consider my own mentors. I suppose, a mentor is someone willing to share what they've learned, and encourage those they work with to improve themselves. I generally feel unworthy of the mentor moniker, but that humble modesty is likely also a piece of what makes a good mentor.

So, what makes a good mentor? What can I do to improve the positive impact I have on those I work with? I'm going to keep a list here of things that I think make a good mentor, and if you can think of some more, please feel free to send a tweet my way!

### Traits and Practices of a Good Mentor
* **Patience** - People learn at their own pace, and a good mentor needs to be able to understand and encourage a person's own discovery process without rushing them along.
* **Kindness** - Nobody really respects a jerk.
* **Curiosity** - Without their own drive to learn and explore, a mentor cannot instill such in others.
* **Positivity** - A positive attitude can inspire people much more than a jaded or negative outlook.
* **Growth Mindset** - A mentor should model a growth mindset, and should employ practices to improve themselves. They should be willing to share those practices with others.
* **Thoroughness** - Mentors should be intentional with the practices they employee. They should also be willing to dive into the _why_ behind something they are doing or teaching. If they don't understand something themselves, they should be willing to explore it to gain a deeper understanding. After all, that's what they should want to pass onto others.
* **Heart of a Teacher** - Mentors should always be glad to pass on their knowledge, and should not be stingy or horde up their expertise. This plays well with many other traits on this list.
* **Candor** - A mentor should be open and honest. This includes being honest about things they do not know and, sometimes, being frank with those that they teach. What I mean is, sometimes you have to be willing to tell someone when they are being negative, unproductive, or are exhibiting counter-productive behaviors.
* **Empathetic** - Mentors should be able to put themselves in others' shoes. They should be understanding of others' circumstances, and able to commiserate with them.
* **Open to Reciprocity** - A mentor should be willing to learn from those that they are sharing their skills and knowledge with. A healthy mentor relationship should be one in which the student is often teaching back to the mentor. The relationship should be reciprocal, and the sentiment should be as well. Both should be willing to express how much they've learned from one another.
